This script provides a minimal working example to implement discretepolicy gradients in Python, using Tensorflow 2.0. It deploys a categorical policy and utilizes the gradient tape to determine weight updates.

The code was released together with the following TowardsDataScience article, providing background on the theory and implementation steps:
